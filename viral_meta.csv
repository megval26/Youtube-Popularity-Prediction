Messi, 25, hit 91 goals during 2012 and beat club team-mate Andres Iniesta and Real Madrid's Ronaldo to the trophy. Despite his goals, the Catalan giants failed to win either the Spanish league title or Champions League last year. Abby Wambach won the women's award and Vicente del Bosque the coach accolade, while the team of the year was made up only of players from Spain's La Liga.  Messi was announced as the winner of the Ballon d'Or, the award given to the world's best player, during a ceremony held in Zurich on Monday. He was part of a three-man shortlist for the prize, which is voted for by journalists, and national coaches and captains, alongside midfielder Iniesta and forward Ronaldo. He becomes the first player to win four consecutive Ballons d'Or, breaking the record he jointly held with former France international, and current Uefa president, Michel Platini.  To tell you the truth this is really quite unbelievable,  said the Argentine.  The fourth award that I have had is just too great for words.  I would like to recognise my other colleagues from Barcelona. Andres, it has been great to train and play alongside you.  I would also like to recognise all of my friends in the Argentina national team, everyone that has worked with me, coaches and staff and my family and my friends. Also my wife and my son. Thank you.  Messi - who polled 41.6% of the votes, with Ronaldo taking 23.68% and Iniesta 10.91% - was favourite to win after surpassing Germany striker Gerd Mueller's record of 85 goals in a calendar year from 1972. He netted 79 goals for Barcelona, plus another 12 for Argentina, in 69 games for club and country.  But Real Madrid clinched the Primera Division with a nine-point winning margin over their arch rivals, who were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by eventual winners Chelsea. Messi also featured in the team of the year, which was made up of 10 players from Barca and Real Madrid plus Atletico Madrid striker Radamel Falcao. USA forward Wambach was named women's world player of the year, the first American to win the award since Mia Hamm in 2002. Del Bosque and Pia Sundhage collected the men's and women's coaching gongs for their work with Spain and USA respectively. Real boss Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola, who left Barca in May to take a year's sabbatical from the game, finished behind Del Bosque. At a news conference before the Ballon d'Or ceremony, Guardiola confirmed he plans to return to management next season The Spaniard, 41, stepped down after winning 14 trophies in four years, including two Champions League crowns and three La Liga titles.  I will return [next season] because I am young, but I have been living the kind of life that I wanted and one that my family also deserved,  said Guardiola, who has relocated to New York with his wife and children. The Puskas Award for goal of the year went to Fenerbahce's Slovakian striker Miroslav Stoch for his strike against Genclerbirligi in March. Franz Beckenbauer received the Fifa Presidential Award and Uzbekistan won the fair play accolade for their disciplinary record."

Before you go all crazy on me for  hurting  cats, you should know that the cats were handled with GREAT care. We decided to keep the shot tight on the cats so that they did not need to be airborne very long. The cats were tossed a few feet into an enormous and ultra soft sheepskin blanket. The cats were treated like royalty. They were fed gourmet cat food and lots of water. We took many breaks where the kittens rested and played in the shade. They were full of energy the entire shoot which lasted a mere one hour. This video was shot six months ago and the cats are alive and in perfect health today. I love cats and would never even consider harming them...so please stop sending me death threats. Anyways...

So after two years of on and off work, with many safety features such as IR proximity sensors to protect Jerry and my son from the machine, I finally complete.    Far from being a replacement for me, I was always right there with him enjoying his fun.  And with all the troubles that I went through to build the ball machine, I still end up throwing more balls than that the machine could count!  According to the computer, he played with the machine by himself only 3 times in his life.  I recently put this video on YouTube to keep alive my earlier memories of him and (hopefully) provide some  humorous distractions  for anyone that might drop by.  Please enjoy the video."

I discovered later that the $3500 guitar was severely damaged.  They didnt deny the experience occurred but for nine months the various people I communicated with put the responsibility for dealing with the damage on everyone other than themselves and finally said they would do nothing to compensate me for my loss.    So I promised the last person to finally say no to compensation (Ms. Irlweg) that I would write and produce three songs about my experience with United Airlines and make videos for each to be viewed online by anyone in the world.   United: Song 1 is the first of those songs.   United: Song 2 has been written and video production is underway.  United: Song 3 is coming.  I promise.  Follow me at http://twitter.com/DaveCarroll .

Black Friday - a key date in the two-month holiday season retail splurge - is the chance for stores across the US to turn a profit for the whole year.  Americans have grown more comfortable shopping online, putting pressure on traditional retailers who can make up to 40% of their annual revenue in November and December.  In what has been dubbed  Gray Thursday , Target opened its doors at 9pm, three hours earlier than last year. Sears, which did not open on Thanksgiving last year, opened at 8pm.  When Macy's opened its doors in New York at midnight, 11,000 shoppers showed up.  For some the lure of the potential bargains was enough to make them miss out on Thanksgiving dinner altogether.  Michael Prothero, 19, and his friend Kenny Fullenlove, 20 started camping out on Monday night outside a Best Buy store in Ohio, which was scheduled to open at midnight.   Better safe than sorry,  Mr Prothero said.  However not everyone was happy with the extended Thanksgiving hours.   It shows that the companies are not valuing their workers. They're looking to their workers to squeeze out more profits,  complained Carrie Gleason, director of the union-backed pressure group Retail Action Project.  Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer which owns Asda in the UK, has been one of the biggest targets of protests against holiday hours.  Many of the its stores open 24 hours, but the company was offering early bird specials, once were reserved for Black Friday, at 8pm on Thanksgiving instead.  OUR Walmart, which includes disgruntled former and current workers, planned demonstrations and walkouts at hundreds of stores on Black Friday.  But retailers say they are giving shoppers what they want.  Kathee Tesija from Target said its 9pm opening struck  a perfect balance  for its customers."

Fife School District Assistant Superintendent Jeff Short said the bus was on its way to Surprise Lake Middle School when the substitute driver became incapacitated.   Seventh-grader Jeremy Wuitschick was on the bus and said the driver let go of the wheel and started flailing his arms.    I knew something was wrong,  he said.Wuitschick said he got up and grabbed the wheel, turned the bus toward the side of the road and turned off the ignition.    It was pretty scary,  Wuitschick said.  It was all happening really quickly.    The bus came to a stop outside of Discovery Pimary School, which is next to Surprise Lake Middle School. John McCrossin, director of student programs for the Fife School District, was driving behind the bus when he noticed the bus veer off to the side of the road.   He ran onto the bus after it stopped and found the driver unconscious and not breathing. The kids told McCrossin they already called 911, so he began performing CPR on the driver until police and medics arrived. The driver was taken to a hospital, but his current condition was not known.   Fife Police Chief Brad Blackburn said no one else was hurt thanks to the students who brought the bus to a safe stop."

All clips are from January 2007. Tillman was a little over a year old at the time.  A little history of this first video. I Filmed the video using a just purchased Panasonic Lumix TZ1. I was bicycling through Venice Beach California when I came upon the skateboarding dog. Originally the first video had the soundtrack  Giving In  by linkin Park. Once the video appeared in iphone commercials I  removed the video from youtube because of the attention it was getting and I had no rights to use the song. As time approached for Apple's release of the iphone with youtube, youtube contacted me and requested I reinstate the video without the soundtrack. Youtube wanted users to be able to view the skateboarding dog in the store and after purchasing their iphone. Unfortunately youtube gave me only a few hours to re-edited video before the iphone release.  The original background sound on most of the clips was ruined by hysterical laughter from a woman watching Tillman so I cut and pasted sound in from other parts of the video to cover the laughter. That's why some claim they hear the word eskimo over and over-lol. When the original video with the Linkin Park soundtrack was selected it had around 15,000 views."

Felix reached a maximum of speed of 1,342.8 km/h (833mph) through the near vacuum of the stratosphere before being slowed by the atmosphere later during his 4:20 minute long freefall. The 43-year-old Austrian skydiving expert also broke two other world records (highest freefall, highest manned balloon flight), leaving the one for the longest freefall to project mentor Col.

Our country, and all of us, need to move from a fossil fuel past to a renewable energy future.   The mood in Britain has turned very much against the Big Six energy companies. And it's not hard to see why. People are fed up with the unethical pricing, complex tariffs, awful customer service and the dire lack of investment in new sources of green energy.  It's become quite unbearable, self evidently. Even the government are calling on people to leave the Big Six.   People:Power can bring change to the energy sector -- when people join Ecotricity they vote with their energy bills - and the more that do so the better. Together we can harness the energy bills of Britain and direct them to a proper outcome - the creation of a Green, energy independent Britain -- a Green Britain.  http://www.ecotricity.co.uk/dump-big-six http://zerocarbonista.com  Music: 'Porgi Amor' from Mozart's 'Le Nozze di Figaro'"

Why   Thriller  ?  visit: http://byronfgarcia.com  1,500 plus CPDRC inmates of the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center, Cebu, Philippines at practice! This is not the final routine, and definitely not a punishment!   WHY THRILLER?  What made me choose Michael Jackson's Thriller for the aerobics routine is that Michael Jackson was a convicted man to the eyes of those who hated him. He would have been in imprisoned had it not been for settlement arrangements, they would say.  Still Michael Jackson's frailty as a human being makes him like one of us -- whether one is a prisoner or not.  I saw in the lyrics and video of Thriller much of what jail culture is like. Because of the hideous conditions in jails, prisons are like tombs and inmates are like ghoulish creatures. The only difference is that dancers in the MJ Thriller video come with make-up and costumes. The Dancing Inmates come as themselves. People perceived to be evil.  The message of the Thriller is a message for all of us. The funk of forty thousand years embedded in the cycle of sin and punishment is a legacy no mere mortal can resist or is capable of resisting. No prison wall can and will stop evil from lurking in the dark. No shackle can stop the beast about to strike. No punitive or brutal treatment is ever too strong to stop creatures crawling in search of blood. Unless we stop breeding demons in jails, gruesome ghouls from every tomb will seal the doom of nations and civilizations.    What I wanted inmates to do in dancing to the Thriller was for them to be convicted to sin. When I uploaded this on the YouTube, what I wanted viewers to see is how evil dances in our lives without knowing its deathly consequences.  But then the song and dance number is but a medium to the message. The message is, governments must stop looking at jails darkly. We have to stop being entertained and thrilled by the sting of sin. We have to look at prisons beyond the cycle of crime and punishment and certainly look inside underlying social, cultural and psychological implications of rehabilitation.  No matter how jails are called, prisons by any name are still hell -- the corpse's shell. It is a location in the map that governments would like to hide but cannot conceal. It's like the  horror looking right between the eyes, you're paralyzed.  This paralyzing reality is such that if we make jails a living hell, we may be breeding the next generation demons or beast and we may be sending out devils once they are released and reintegrated to society.  Michael Jackson may have exposed the evils of this Earth in the Thriller but he had a strong message of saving humanity from doom in his  Heal the World  where he said  heal the world, make it a better place, for you and for me and the entire human race.  Michael Jackson's message was a message of salvation.  There are people dying if you care enough for the living, make it a better place for you and for me.  We may have missed out what Michael was trying to say beyond the lyrics.    PEACE TO ALL MANKIND!   Byron F. Garcia"

Johnson  I'm checking out your Facebook I drive past where you work You tell me you're my girlfriend But are you even on planet earth? I see you out with your friends but Yo who the hell is that dude? You're not playing with me are you girl? Well hell, I wouldn't put it past you I hate that you just won't text me You say you're out with Becky Why you dress so sexy I check my text every five seconds obsessing That you're in another dude's bedroom undressing.   He's got you pressed on your back It's a wrestling match Well anything he's good at I'm the best at that My heart was broken I was hoping it would be left in tact So please let's just chat Just text me back!   I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy Until I met you Crazy I wasn't crazy Until I met you   I refresh your Facebook Analyze all your wall posts Why'd you leave a smiley face on that one dude's page Or whatever you call those The fact that you flirt with That dirty rat that you work with I feel the love boat sinking I'm trying to bring it back to the surface Why do you keep pictures of your ex around? You think he's better than me? Why you letting me drown? In my own imagination That I face when I'm alone I'm going to wait until you sleep And then I'm going through your phone 'Cause I don't believe you when you tell me He's only a friend I'm not possessive, I'm depressed You let me feel lonely again So I'm sitting in my bedroom checkin' your Facebook Checkin you're Facebook Text me back!   I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy Until I met you Crazy I wasn't crazy Until I met you I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy Until I met you   I had a dream that I killed you I'm not certain what it means I didn't say that I would do it I said it was a dream Anger is the lone emotion flowing through my veins Knowing  you I may spend the night Going through some pain Call me insane call me obsessed The fact remains that I will rage Unless you text me back!   I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy Until I met you I wasn't crazy Until I met you   I wasn't crazy Until I met you   I wasn't crazy Until I met you   I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy Until I met you"

For more information on ARCAS, please visit their website at http://www.arcasguatemala.com  This monkey came into ARCAS care on the 29th of february at 549g, the 4th of may the day of the filming he was 655g, and right now he is 688g and eats by himself. The process of rehabilitation of spider monkeys includes hand feeding and introduction of tastes and textures for several weeks or months. He was fed with a syringe adapted with a bottle nipple for a few weeks, and then introduced to solid food (what is shown in the video), and now has grown into feeding by himself, this will lead to growth and strengthening before he can be introduced to more monkeys in a near future to form a troop and develop into a candidate for release within a healthy group. Due to their physiology juvenile spider monkeys bulge a lot after feeding and will have an almost empty digestive system within 2 or 3 hours.   Caution: This video contains some minor cursing and some major laughter."

Yes we can.  It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail toward freedom.  Yes we can.  It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness.  Yes we can.  It was the call of workers who organized; women who reached for the ballots; a President who chose the moon as our new frontier; and a King who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the Promised Land.  Yes we can to justice and equality.  Yes we can to opportunity and prosperity.  Yes we can heal this nation.  Yes we can repair this world.  Yes we can.  We know the battle ahead will be long, but always remember that no matter what obstacles stand in our way, nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change.  We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics...they will only grow louder and more dissonant ........... We've been asked to pause for a reality check. We've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope.  But in the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope.  Now the hopes of the little girl who goes to a crumbling school in Dillon are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of LA; we will remember that there is something happening in America; that we are not as divided as our politics suggests; that we are one people; we are one nation; and together, we will begin the next great chapter in the American story with three words that will ring from coast to coast; from sea to shining sea --  Yes.

None of them are incredibly bad, but they are definitely things a little kid shouldn't hear... not to mention things MY KID shouldn't say! If you want to see the original Facebook thread, it's located at: http://www.facebook.com/tommyjordaniii/posts/299559803434210 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  My daughter thought it would be funny/rebellious/cool to post on her Facebook wall just how upset she was and how unfair her life here is; how we work her too hard with chores, never pay her for chores, and just in general make her life difficult.  She chose to share this with the entire world on Facebook and block her parent's from seeing it. Well, umm... she failed. As of the end of this video, she won't have to worry anymore about posting inappropriate things on Facebook...  Maybe a few kids can take something away from this... If you're so disrespectful to your parents and yourself as to post this kind of thing on Facebook, you're deserving of some tough love. Today, my daughter is getting a dose of tough love.   © Copyright 2012, by Tommy Jordan. All rights reserved. Duplication without express permission of the author is prohibited."

The tree across the street was blowing into a high voltage power line and catching on fire. We called the Bellingham FIRE DEPARTMENT about 10 minutes before we started filming- many people called. (Puget Sound Energy was also called) They showed up about 5 minutes after we stopped filming. They missed the big show!    No one got hurt. The power was out for a few hours while the tree was cut down. The family that lived in the house next to the tree evacuated long before we started filming.  What an insane thing to see. Neighbours from 4+ blocks away were coming to see what was going on because they could FEEL and hear the first explosion. Nuts."

My hot water heater leaked and flooded my kitchen and so I just went through getting it replaced.  We have had so much snow (it's melting now) that it was too hard to carry it through all the snow to get to the landfill so it and other building materials are hanging out on my porch until more snow is gone.  See how the fox, eagle and cat are all just fine hanging out and no one is trying to attack anyone and they are getting along just fine?  Notice the eagle in the background on the lamp post down by the street.  That is the partner to this eagle. They aren't always out to attack and kill each other.  Our fox and eagles and cats basically get along just fine here.  Sometimes if there is food they might fight over the food some.  I live in Unalaska, Alaska in the Aleutian Islands.  Also, earlier in the day when the fox first came Gizmo my cat went right up to the fox and told him to leave.  It was too funny!  But the fox came right back!"

Barb Roettger had her camera rolling as two hefty whales popped out of the calm waters not far from the unsuspecting surfer and a pair of kayakers.  A pod of humpback whales has been hanging out off the Santa Cruz coast, noshing on anchovies that flock to the area to feed on plankton. The woman found herself in the middle of a feeding frenzy called lunge feeding, which occurs when whales herd anchovies and shoot straight up out of the water with their mouth wide open to catch the fish.   The whales have had quite a few dangerous close encounters with humans and boats in recent months. Whale watchers are warned to stay at least 100 yards away from the feeding area which can be a quarter mile square. Roettger says she has now gained a greater respect for whales, their feeding patterns and will now only spectate from the decidedly safer dry land.

The pavement caved in under the teenager's weight as soon as she stepped onto a section of the walkway.  What followed was a dramatic rescue attempt by a passing taxi driver. His heroic actions were also filmed by close circuit television and on mobile phones.  The passing cab driver stopped immediately at the scene and climbed into the six-metre deep pit to help the girl.   I called out to her but she didn't respond.

Thanks for all the positive feedback - and to =3 for making me laugh, you are hilarious.  Ok- so I only posted this video because my son wanted to see if we could get 1,000 hits. And I thought maybe having a little fun with it might help me deal with it too. I disabled comments because people were being so incredibly mean. So far I've been accused of faking it (really?), been blamed for everything from the high price of gas global warming, and it was getting out of hand. Believe it or don't, it really did happen. Analyze the why's and how's if you need to, but I only thought it was an incredible dose of reality and that people would be shocked to see it. And really people, why in the world would you have to be so hateful???         Pay attention at the 30 second mark. No- it wasn't an April Fools joke, it really happened, and I was fine."

Im from Long island new york. The dog is GERONIMO and shes a 2 year old cattle dog mix. could be mixed with border collie or kelpie, who knows! I pulled her out of a pound in Missouri while I was performing there 2 summers ago. She was 3 months old. Mo's specialty is tricks. She loves to train tricks, but also has a knack for agility and frisbee. I have 7 dogs total, all mixes of herding dogs, which are my favorite.  I travel around the country performing with STUNT DOG PRODUCTIONS, creators of the theater show THE STUNT DOG EXPERIENCE and the state fair shows THE EXTREME CANINES SHOW. We perform all across the country and also have performed in Canada.   Now, about this trick. This trick took 5 straight weeks until it was perfect for me to call complete. I practiced it every single day, several hours a day. Now, there are alot of hours in a day, folks, and I like frequent breaks (although mo wonders why we are stopping and not jumping all day long ;) Mo will work all day, she loves to EAT!! This is the first time Ive trained this specific trick so it was all trial and error. There was no specific steps I really took that made a huge difference. All I can really remember doing is trying a bunch of different things, rewarding her small successes until the trick was complete. To the lovely people that are asking about the stick on the ground. I trained Mo to jump behind the stick. It has nothing to do with the ropes itself. This trick is so amazing because of all the things going on at once. Think about it....she has to find that  sweet spot  in the rope where she can jump in, wait for the perfect time to jump in, watch the board on the floor and the ropes at the same time so she knows where and when to jump in, then she must time the jump perfectly, land, and immediately find the rhythm of the ropes and jump. shes just not running and gunning it. she waits for the right time (which through hrs of practice, has figured out) and jumps in. The stick is there to keep her in the middle of the ropes, as i found out by teaching my other dogs to jump with just one rope, that they all want to jump right on top of you or into you really closely. My vision for this trick is exactly how you see it now....a dog that runs and jumps into 2 ropes while staying in the middle as if it were jumping like a human. Im happy with the end result. Mo is happy to jump, and I hope you all are happy to view her video and watch her having a good time.  This trick was originally trained so I can bring a new trick to THE STUNT DOG EXPERIENCE show we will be performing at DOLLYWOOD theme park this summer, June to the first week in August. I wasnt going to put out a video at all. I was going to wait and debut the trick on stage at dollywood. Then my first jump rope dog died and I became extremely depressed. 10 years ago I got TESS for my birthday and that dog molded me into the trainer I am today. My boyfriend suggested I put out the video anyway because its such a fun trick. The entire video was filmed by my friend STEVE COLLIER and the video is dedicated to the dog that jump started my training career....TESS, who appears in a few of my earlier videos.   The guy opposite me, turning the ropes is my boyfriend...SCOTT LEVY. Yes. hes scrawny. We get the memo, thank you. Love him to death and scrawny guys are the way to go ;)  If you are going to sit here and bitch about the font, your just lame. if you dont like my music choice, your on the internet. Your on a computer. Each one of these devices has a volume button.....utilize it and quit your bitching :) thank you.   Now, about that yard. Its dirt. Its grass. Its HIDEOUS, i know. See that big ass house in the background, folks? Its brand new. Just moved back into it late november due to construction. After they bulldozed the top half of my house and built upwards, adding 6 new rooms, they decided to get to work on the yard. I filmed this as work was being done on the yard.since ive been a lazy ass on this channel lately and apparently only seem to put out one video per year, next years video will be with a lush green field of grass with trees along the fence, an inground pool thats uncovered that you will jealous of, and my dogs doing what they do best...being awesome while having a good time! :)  THIS VIDEO IS DEDICATED TO TESS, THE DOG THAT TAUGHT ME TO JUMP ROPE.

His mom wasnt able to go becasue of work. I taped some of the morning before the surgery to show her and was already planning to tape afterwards. He had just had a tooth removed due to Hyperdontia or extra tooth. This was taken in the parking lot of the dentist office. He was so out of it. The staff was even laughing. This lasted for a few hours and he was fine. He even laughed at the video that night.  He is very smart and always has something interesting to say about many different issues. His philosophical reaction to the medication didnt really suprise us.  David is a very good kid and I am blessed to have he and his brother William as sons.

So please, feel free to share this video link with others!  Edit: I have received a lot of posts saying my cat has some health issue with him. Before you post anymore comments on that topic ask yourself these questions: 1) Are you a qualified pet health expert? 2) Do you know the medical history of this cat? 3) Do you know how the cat responds after doing this? 4) Do you think you can honestly diagnose anything based solely on a video?  If you answered yes to ALL of those questions, then please feel free to give us advice on the care of our cat. If you answered no to ANY of those questions, please realize that you do not posses the expertise to make such claims. The cat has also been to our vet. and has checked out healthy. There is no need to tell me how to care for my cat and I respectfully ask you to keep your medical opinion to yourself. I cannot stress that enough.  Also just to clarify for those who may be wondering our little boy was adopted from Cat City, which is affiliated with P.A.W.S. He was found abandoned on an island here in the Puget Sound and was brought there for care and to prepare him for being adopted. He was approximately three weeks old when he was found and we got him shortly after he turned one month old. Thus his urge to suckle is strong because he was not weened off of his mother's milk like most cats. We did not adopt him from a kitten farm or from any other illegitimate cat spawning facility.  We love our kitten very much and we are joking when we call him  stupid.  He is a happy, healthy cat who is well taken care of.

Go to http://www.indiegogo.com/helpmefind for more information :))  Many thanks!!!  This short film is about a piece of footage I (George Clarke) found behind the scenes in Charlie Chaplins film 'The Circus'. Attending the premiere at Manns Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, CA - the scene shows a large woman dressed in black with a hat hiding most of her face, with what can only be described as a mobile phone device - talking as she walks alone.   I have studied this film for over a year now - showing it to over 100 people and at a film festival, yet no-one can give any explanation as to what she is doing.  My only theory - as well as many others - is simple... a time traveler on a mobile phone. See for yourself and feel free to leave a comment on your own explanation or thoughts about it.
